# Introduction to complex systems project 1A
This is the introduction to complex system project 1A of group 6. The implementation of the code is in Python. The code for Part 1 can be found under simulation1.py and the simulation for part 2.1 can be found under simulation2.ipynb. Note that in both simulations the code has been sped up by making use of the Python package Numba.
